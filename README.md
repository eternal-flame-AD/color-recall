# Color-Recall

A simple color recall game made with Rust and built as WebAssembly. Designed to test your recall precision of colors.

## How to play

1. You will be shown a color, you can look at it for as long as you want.

2. The color will disappear for 10 seconds.

3. You will be shown a color picker, you have to pick the color you saw. You can also take as long as you want because you are likely to do worse by taking more time.

4. The score is the CIEDE2000 ΔE’ between the color you picked and the original color.
